src/processor.py,"This Python script contains functions related to managing a codebase. The get_requirements() function uses the pipreqs library to generate a requirements.txt file for the project. The get_tmpdir() function returns a temporary directory path, deleting and recreating it if it already exists. The clone_codebase() function clones a git repository and installs the requirements.txt file. Finally, the parse_codebase() function parses a directory of python files and returns a dictionary of"
src/logger.py,"This Python script sets up a logger with a ColoredFormatter, which allows for different log levels to be printed in different colors. It also sets the log level to DEBUG."
src/model.py,"This script uses the OpenAI API to generate a summary of a Python script. It takes in a dictionary of files and code, and for each file and code, it creates a prompt asking to summarize the code. It then uses the OpenAI API to generate a summary of the code, and appends the file and summary to a list. Finally, it returns the list of files and summaries."
src/builder.py,"This script is used to create an HTML file from a CSV file. It imports the Pandas library and the utils module, and defines two functions: get_pkg_icons and create_header. The get_pkg_icons function takes a path to a JSON file and returns a dictionary of icons. The create_header function takes a path to a JSON file, a list of packages, and a name, and returns a string of HTML. The create_html function takes an icon"
src/utils.py,"This Python script contains four functions. The first function, get_pkgs_list(), reads a requirements.txt file and returns a list of packages. The second function, read_json(), reads a json file and returns its contents as a dictionary. The third function, write_file(), writes a file to a given path. The fourth function, markdownify(), converts a string to markdown."
src/main.py,"This Python script takes a URL as input and creates a markdown documentation of the codebase. It uses the Hydra library to parse the configuration file, the Pandas library to store the summary of the codebase, and the Path library to resolve the paths of the files. It also uses the builder, logger, model, processor, and utils modules to clone the codebase, parse the codebase, create a summary of the codebase, and create the markdown documentation. Finally,"
