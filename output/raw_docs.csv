src/processor.py,"This script contains functions related to managing a Python project. The get_requirements() function uses the pipreqs library to generate a requirements.txt file for the project. The get_tmpdir() function returns a temporary directory path, deleting and recreating it if it already exists. The clone_codebase() function clones a git repository and installs the requirements.txt file. Finally, the parse_codebase() function parses a directory of python files and returns a dictionary of the"
src/logger.py,"This Python script sets up a logger with a ColoredFormatter, which allows for different log levels to be printed in different colors. It also sets the log level to DEBUG."
src/model.py,"This script uses the OpenAI API to summarize the code in a specified GitHub repository. It takes in a language model and a dictionary of files and code as arguments. It then iterates through the files and code, skipping the __init__ file, and uses the OpenAI API to generate a summary of the code for each file. The summaries are stored in a dictionary and returned."
src/builder.py,"This script is used to create an HTML file from a CSV file. It imports the Pandas library and a utils module, and defines two functions. The first function, get_pkg_icons(), takes a path to a JSON file and returns a dictionary of icons. The second function, create_header(), takes a path to a JSON file and a list of packages and returns a string of HTML. The last function, create_html(), takes a string of badges, a name,"
src/utils.py,"This Python script contains four functions. The first function, get_pkgs_list(), reads a requirements.txt file and returns a list of packages. The second function, read_json(), reads a json file and returns its contents as a dictionary. The third function, write_file(), writes a file to a given path. The fourth function, markdownify(), converts a string to markdown."
src/main.py,"""""""
This Python script is used to generate a Markdown documentation file from a codebase. It imports various modules, sets up a logger, and defines a main function. The main function clones the codebase from a given URL, parses the codebase, and converts the code into text. It then creates a dataframe with the file names and summaries, and saves it to a CSV file. It also creates a list of packages used in the codebase, creates a header with"
