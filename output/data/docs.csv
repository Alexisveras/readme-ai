src/processor.py,"This Python script contains functions to clone a codebase from a given URL, create a temporary directory, and parse the codebase into a dictionary. The clone_codebase() function clones the codebase from the given URL into the temporary directory created by the get_tmpdir() function. The parse_codebase() function then reads all the Python files in the codebase and stores them in a dictionary with the file path as the key and the file contents as the value."
src/logger.py,"This Python script sets up a logger with a ColoredFormatter, which allows for different log levels to be printed in different colors. It also sets the log level to DEBUG, which will print all log messages."
src/model.py,This script uses the OpenAI API to generate a summary of a Python script. It takes in a dictionary of files and code as an argument and loops through each file and code. It then creates a prompt for the OpenAI API to generate a summary of the code. The script then stores the summary in a list and returns the list of summaries.
src/builder.py,"This Python script imports the Pandas library and reads a CSV file. It then iterates through the rows of the CSV file and creates an HTML document with a description of each row. The HTML document includes a roadmap, licenses, overview, prerequisites, repository structure, and modules."
src/main.py,"This Python script is used to document a codebase. It takes a URL as input, uses an engine to parse the codebase, and then creates a summary of the codebase in a CSV file. It also creates HTML and Markdown documents of the codebase."
