src/processor.py,"This Python script contains functions to clone a codebase from a given URL, create a temporary directory, and parse the codebase into a dictionary. The clone_codebase() function clones the codebase from the given URL into the temporary directory created by the get_tmpdir() function. The parse_codebase() function then reads all the Python files in the codebase and stores them in a dictionary with the file path as the key and the file contents as the value."
src/logger.py,"This Python script sets up a logger with a ColoredFormatter, which allows for different log levels to be printed in different colors. It also sets the log level to DEBUG, which will print all log messages."
src/model.py,This script uses the OpenAI API to generate a summary of a Python script. It takes in a dictionary of files and code as an argument and loops through each file and code. It then creates a prompt for the OpenAI API to generate a summary of the code. The script then stores the summary in a list and returns the list of summaries.
src/builder.py,"This script creates an HTML page with information about OpenAI Auto Markdown Docs. It imports the Pandas library and reads a CSV file containing the names of scripts and their descriptions. It then creates an HTML page with a header, a section for software and packages, a section for the repository structure, and a section for the roadmap. It also includes images and badges for the software and packages."
src/main.py,"This Python script uses the hydra library to set up a configuration file, then uses the pathlib library to create a directory for the output. It uses the markdownify library to convert HTML documents to markdown documents. It then uses the builder, logger, model, and processor modules to clone a codebase from a given URL, parse the codebase, convert the code to text, and create HTML and markdown documents. Finally, it logs a message that the code-to-language"
