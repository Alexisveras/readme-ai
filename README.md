## Overview

PydocsAI is a Python package that provides an automated way to generate a README.md file and document your codebase. This package leverages OpenAI's GPT Davinci model to translate a given codebase to natural language, producing a structured project README template that contains codebase metadata and code documentation.

The project is still under development and is very opinionated in its setup, but it can be used as a starting point for projects that require documentation. The current version of PyDocsAI is limited to codebases written in Python.

## Use-Case

Software, data, machine learning, or any project that requires documentation!

## Feautres

### Badges

Analyzes your project's dependencies and requirements, displaying them as badges in the README's header section.
