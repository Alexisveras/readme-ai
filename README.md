# Kookiekutter template to create beautiful README markdown documentation for a codebase

- Analyze codebase and construct template with icons such as Shields.io badges depending on what packages they're using.

- Then use ChatGPT to write initial documenation for each directory of the codebase.

- You will obviously need to review and add, but its a good start and saves a lot of time.
