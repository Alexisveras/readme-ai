src/conf.py,"This code defines a class called AppConfig which contains four other classes: OpenAI, GitHub, Html, and Paths. OpenAI contains two variables, engine and key, both of which are strings. GitHub contains one variable, url, which is a string. Html contains four variables, head, body, setup, and tree, all of which are strings. Paths contains four variables, badges, docs, html, and md, all of which are strings."
src/processor.py,"This code provides functions to clone a GitHub repository, get the packages and file extensions used in the repository, and parse the codebase into a dictionary. It also provides a context manager to clone the repository to a temporary directory."
src/logger.py,This code creates a Logger class that is used to log messages with different levels of severity. It imports the logging and colorlog modules and configures the logger with a StreamHandler and a ColoredFormatter. It also provides methods for logging messages with different levels of severity.
src/model.py,"This code imports the OpenAI library and sets the API key from the environment. It then defines a function, code_to_text(), which takes an engine and a dictionary of files and code as parameters. The function iterates through the files and code, skips any files that are not Python files, and creates a prompt for each file. It then uses the OpenAI library to generate a summary of the code and appends the file and summary to a list. Finally, the function"
src/builder.py,"This code is used to build a HTML page from a given configuration file, a list of packages, and a URL. It reads a JSON file containing badges, creates a header with the badges, creates a body from a CSV file, and creates a setup page. It also clones a repository from the given URL and creates a tree.md file with the directory structure of the repository."
src/utils.py,"The FileFactory class is a Python module that provides methods for reading and writing various file types, such as JSON, CSV, HTML, Markdown, and TOML. It takes a base path as an argument and uses it to construct the file path for the specified file name."
src/main.py,"This code is a Python script that reads a configuration file, clones a codebase from a given URL, uses an OpenAI engine to generate a code summary, writes the summary to a CSV file, and builds a project readme."
