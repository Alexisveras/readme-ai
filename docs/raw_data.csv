module,summary
tests/test_model.py,This code is a unit test for the code_to_text function in the model module. It mocks the openai.Completion.create function and tests the code_to_text function with two different files. It then checks that the expected output is returned.
tests/test_utils.py,"This code is a Python file containing utility functions for testing. It contains two functions, 'assert_equal' and 'assert_not_equal', which are used to compare two values and check if they are equal or not. The functions will return a boolean value indicating the result of the comparison."
tests/conftest.py,"This code is a pytest configuration file. It defines two fixtures, test_conf and my_fixture. The test_conf fixture has a scope of ""function"" while the my_fixture fixture returns a list of numbers."
tests/test_conf.py,"This code is a test for the AppConfig class. It creates an instance of AppConfig with OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, and Paths objects as parameters. It then tests the values of the parameters to make sure they are correct."
tests/test_builder.py,"This code is a Python script for testing a builder module. It contains a class called TestBuilder which has two methods: test_build_and_run and test_run. The test_build_and_run method tests the build and run functionality of the builder module, while the test_run method tests the run functionality of the builder module."
tests/test_processor.py,"This code is a test file for a processor module. It contains a test class with two test methods, test_process_data and test_process_file. The test_process_data method tests the processor module's ability to process data, while the test_process_file method tests the processor module's ability to process a file. Both methods use the unittest library to assert the expected results."
tests/test_main.py,"This code tests the main.py file by mocking the configuration dictionary, files, and other functions. It checks that the logger is called correctly, the configuration file is read, the codebase is cloned, the code is converted to text, and the builder is built. It also checks that the correct file is written with the code summary."
tests/test_logger.py,"This code is a test file for a logger module. It contains a test class with two test methods, test_logger_logs_message and test_logger_logs_warning. These methods test the functionality of the logger module to ensure that it is logging messages and warnings correctly."
src/conf.py,"This code defines a class called AppConfig which contains five other classes: OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, Paths, and AppConfig. Each of these classes contains variables that are used to store information related to the project."
src/processor.py,"This code is a function that clones a GitHub repository to a temporary directory, parses the codebase to get each file as a raw string, gets the file extensions and packages to help generate project badge icons, and creates an environment file."
src/logger.py,This code creates a Logger class that is used to log messages with different levels of severity. It imports the logging and colorlog modules and sets up a StreamHandler with a ColoredFormatter to format the log messages. It also provides methods for logging messages with different levels of severity.
src/model.py,This code is a Python function that uses the OpenAI Codex API to summarize Python code. It takes two parameters: an engine name and a dictionary of file names and code contents. It returns a dictionary of file names and code summaries. It also includes an exception handler for OpenAI API errors.
src/builder.py,"This code is a function that builds a markdown file from a configuration object, a list of packages, and a URL. It reads a CSV file, reads a JSON file, and uses the git library to clone a repository. It then formats the markdown file with the data from the CSV and JSON files, and the repository tree."
src/utils.py,"FileFactory is a class that creates a FileHandler object based on the file type of the file path provided. The FileHandler class is an abstract class that provides methods for reading and writing files. There are five subclasses of FileHandler that provide specific implementations for reading and writing files of different types (CSV, JSON, HTML, MD, and TOML)."
src/main.py,"""""""
This code is a script for a program called PydocsAI. It imports various modules and reads a configuration file. It then clones a codebase from a given URL and creates a list of packages and extensions. It then uses an OpenAI engine to generate a summary of the code and writes it to a CSV file. Finally, it builds the project readme docs and prints a message to the user."
packages,"The code provided is a list of Python libraries, including 'black', 'colorlog', 'coverage', 'dacite', 'flake8', 'GitPython', 'isort', 'openai', 'pandas', 'pipreqs', 'pytest', 'setuptools', and 'tabulate', as well as 'toml'."
extensions,"The code provided is a list of file extensions, including sample, yaml, png, HEAD, idx, csv, md, pack, packed-refs, sh, config, gitignore, description, toml, txt, index, py, exclude, json, Makefile, and main."
