src/conf.py,"This code defines a class called AppConfig which contains five other classes: OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, Paths, and AppConfig. Each of these classes contains variables that are used to store information related to the project."
src/processor.py,"This code is a function that clones a GitHub repository to a temporary directory, parses the codebase to get each file as a raw string, gets the file extensions and packages to help generate project badge icons, and creates an environment file."
src/logger.py,This code creates a Logger class that is used to log messages with different levels of severity. It also configures the logger to use a colored formatter to display the log messages with different colors for different levels of severity.
src/model.py,This code is a Python function that uses the OpenAI Codex API to summarize Python code. It takes two parameters: an engine name and a dictionary of file names and code contents. It returns a dictionary of file names and code summaries. It also includes an exception handler for OpenAI API errors.
src/builder.py,"This code is a function that builds a markdown file from a configuration object, a list of packages, and a URL. It reads a CSV file, reads a JSON file, and uses the git library to clone a repository. It then formats the markdown file with the data it has collected and writes it to a file."
src/utils.py,"The FileFactory class is a utility class that provides a get_handler() method which takes a file path as an argument and returns a FileHandler object based on the file type. The FileHandler class is an abstract class that provides read_file() and write_file() methods. There are five subclasses of FileHandler that provide implementations for reading and writing different file types (CSV, JSON, HTML, MD, and TOML)."
src/main.py,"""""""
This code is for a program called PydocsAI. It reads a configuration file, clones a codebase from a given URL, and uses an OpenAI engine to generate a summary of the code. It then writes the summary to a CSV file and builds the project readme docs. Finally, it logs that the processing is complete and the readme docs can be found in the docs folder."
packages,"The code provided is a list of Python libraries, including 'black', 'colorlog', 'coverage', 'dacite', 'flake8', 'GitPython', 'isort', 'openai', 'pandas', 'pipreqs', 'pytest', 'setuptools', and 'tabulate', as well as 'toml'."
extensions,"This code provides a list of file types that are commonly used in software development, such as packed-refs, Makefile, HEAD, json, csv, pack, yaml, index, gitignore, toml, idx, md, config, sample, txt, py, exclude, and png."
