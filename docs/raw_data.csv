module,summary
tests/test_model.py,This code tests the code_to_text function from the model module. It uses the unittest and mock libraries to mock the openai Completion. create function and test the code_to_text function.
tests/test_utils.py,"This code is a Python module containing utility functions for testing. It provides a set of functions to help automate the process of testing code, such as generating test data, running tests, and verifying results."
tests/conftest.py,"This code is a pytest configuration file which sets up two fixtures, test_conf and my_fixture, for use in tests."
tests/test_conf.py,"This code tests the AppConfig class, which is used to store configuration information for a project. It tests the OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, and Paths classes, which are used to store information about the project's API, GitHub repository, Markdown documentation, and file paths."
tests/test_builder.py,This code is a test suite for a builder module. It contains tests to ensure that the builder module is functioning correctly and producing the expected results.
tests/test_processor.py,This code is a test suite for a processor module. It contains unit tests to ensure that the processor module is functioning correctly.
tests/test_main.py,"This test_main() function tests the main() function in the main. py file. It mocks the configuration dictionary, files, and other functions to ensure that the main() function is working properly."
tests/test_logger.py,This code is a test file for a logger module. It contains tests to ensure that the logger module is functioning correctly and is able to log messages to the console.
src/conf.py,"This code defines a configuration constants object, AppConfig, which contains five dataclasses: OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, Paths, and AppConfig."
src/processor.py,"This code is a processor for a Git repository. It clones the repository, parses the contents, and creates an environment file."
src/logger.py,"This code is a Logger class that provides logging functionality with colored output. It allows for logging messages at different levels (e. g. info, debug, warning, error, critical) and provides a colored output for each level."
src/model.py,This code is a Python module that uses OpenAI's Codex API to summarize Python code. It takes a dictionary of file names and code contents as an argument and returns a dictionary of file names and code summaries.
src/builder.py,"This code is a Python script that builds a markdown file from a configuration object, a list of packages, and a URL. It uses the pandas library to read a CSV file, and the git library to clone a repository."
src/utils.py,"This code creates a FileFactory class that can be used to read and write data from different file types, such as CSV, JSON, HTML, MD, and TOML."
src/main.py,"This code is a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to generate a project README. md file. It loads a configuration file, clones the project codebase, and uses the OpenAI engine to generate a summary of the code."
packages,"This code is a list of Python packages, including 'black' for code formatting, 'colorlog' for logging, 'coverage' for measuring code coverage, 'dacite' for data conversion, 'flake8' for linting, 'GitPython' for interacting with Git repositories, 'isort' for sorting imports, 'openai' for machine learning, 'pandas' for data analysis, 'pipreqs' for generating requirements files,"
extensions,"This code contains a variety of files, including configuration files (toml, json, yaml, config), programming files (py, sh, md, txt), image files (png), and other files (description, gitignore, packed-refs, main, sample, idx, HEAD, exclude, Makefile, csv, pack, LICENSE, index)."
