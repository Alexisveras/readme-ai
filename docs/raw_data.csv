module,summary
src/conf.py,"This code defines a class called AppConfig which contains five other classes: OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, Paths, and AppConfig. Each of these classes contains variables that are used to store information related to the project."
src/processor.py,"This code is a function that clones a GitHub repository to a temporary directory, parses the codebase to get each file as a raw string, gets the file extensions and packages to help generate project badge icons, and creates an environment file."
src/logger.py,This code creates a Logger class that is used to log messages with different levels of severity. It imports the logging and colorlog modules and sets up a StreamHandler with a ColoredFormatter to format the log messages. It also provides methods for logging messages with different levels of severity.
src/model.py,This code is a Python function that uses the OpenAI Codex API to summarize Python code. It takes two parameters: an engine name and a dictionary of file names and code contents. It returns a dictionary of file names and code summaries. It also includes an exception handler for OpenAI API errors.
src/builder.py,"This code is a function that builds a markdown file from a configuration object, a list of packages, and a URL. It reads a CSV file, creates a header with badges, creates tables from the CSV file, and creates a tree from the URL. It then writes the markdown file to a specified path."
src/utils.py,"The FileFactory class is a utility class that provides a get_handler() method which takes a file path as an argument and returns a FileHandler object based on the file type. The FileHandler class is an abstract class that provides read_file() and write_file() methods. There are five subclasses of FileHandler that provide implementations for reading and writing different file types (CSV, JSON, HTML, MD, and TOML)."
src/main.py,"""""""
This code is a Python script that uses the dacite, builder, model, processor, AppConfig, Logger, and FileFactory modules to process a GitHub repository. It reads a configuration file, clones the codebase, and uses an OpenAI engine to generate a code summary. It then writes the summary to a CSV file and builds the project documentation. Finally, it logs a message that the processing is complete and the documentation can be found in the docs folder."
packages,"The code provided is a list of Python libraries, including 'black', 'colorlog', 'coverage', 'dacite', 'flake8', 'GitPython', 'isort', 'openai', 'pandas', 'pipreqs', 'pytest', 'setuptools', and 'tabulate', as well as 'toml'."
extensions,"This code provides a list of file types that are commonly used in software development, such as YAML, IDX, Makefile, TOML, PNG, JSON, SH, MD, TXT, CSV, and PY. Additionally, it includes some version control files such as HEAD, description, pack, gitignore, exclude, packed-refs, and config."
