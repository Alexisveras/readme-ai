module,summary
tests/test_model.py,This code is a unit test for the code_to_text() function in the model.py file.It mocks the openai.Completion.create() function and tests the code_to_text() function with two different files.
tests/test_utils.py,"This code is a Python file containing utility functions for testing.It contains two functions, 'assert_equal' and 'assert_not_equal', which are used to compare two values and check if they are equal or not."
tests/conftest.py,"This code is a pytest configuration file.It defines two fixtures, test_conf and my_fixture.The test_conf fixture has a scope of ""function"" while the my_fixture fixture returns a list of numbers."
tests/test_conf.py,"This code is a test for the AppConfig class.It creates an instance of AppConfig with OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, and Paths objects as parameters."
tests/test_builder.py,This code is a Python script for testing a builder module.It contains a class called TestBuilder which has two methods: test_build_and_run and test_run.
tests/test_processor.py,This code is a test file for a processor module.It contains a class called TestProcessor which has two methods: test_process_data and test_process_file.
tests/test_main.py,"This code tests the main.py file by mocking the configuration dictionary, files, and other functions.It checks that the logger is called correctly, the configuration file is read, the codebase is cloned, the code is converted to text, and the builder is built."
tests/test_logger.py,"This code is a test file for a logger module.It contains a test class with two test methods, test_logger_logs_message and test_logger_logs_warning."
src/conf.py,"This code defines a class called AppConfig which contains five other classes: OpenAI, GitHub, Markdown, Paths, and AppConfig."
src/processor.py,"This code provides functions to clone a Git repository, parse its contents, get the packages and extensions used in the repository, and create a conda environment file."
src/logger.py,This code creates a Logger class that is used to log messages with different levels of severity.It also configures the logger to use a colored formatter to display the log messages with different colors for different levels of severity.
src/model.py,This code is a Python module that provides a function to summarize Python code using OpenAI's Codex API.It also provides a function to summarize text.
src/builder.py,"This code is a function that builds a markdown file from a configuration object, a list of packages, and a URL.It reads a CSV file, creates a header with badges, creates a table of contents, creates a tree of the repository, and creates a usage section."
src/utils.py,FileFactory is a class that creates a FileHandler object based on the file type of the file path provided.The FileHandler class is an abstract class that provides methods for reading and writing files.
src/main.py,"This code is a script that uses the dacite, builder, model, processor, AppConfig, Logger, and FileFactory modules to generate a README.md file for a project."
packages,"The code provided is a list of Python libraries, including 'black', 'colorlog', 'coverage', 'dacite', 'flake8', 'GitPython', 'isort', 'openai', 'pandas', 'pipreqs', 'pytest', 'setuptools', and 'tabulate', as well as 'toml'."
extensions,"The code provided is a list of file types.It includes Python (.py), Portable Network Graphics (.png), Comma-Separated Values (.csv), License (.LICENSE), Shell Script (.sh),"
