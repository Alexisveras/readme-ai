## 📍 Overview

The file.io-Android-Client project is a mobile application that allows users to easily upload and share files. The app provides a convenient and secure way to quickly send files to others, without the need for complex file-sharing platforms or email attachments. Users can select files from their device and upload them to the file.io server, which generates a unique link that can be shared with recipients. The files are encrypted during transit and stored securely on the server for a limited period of time before being automatically deleted. This project offers a simple and efficient solution for file sharing, making it a valuable tool for both personal and professional use.
