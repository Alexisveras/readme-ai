| [git_operations.py](https://github.com/eli64s/readme-ai/blob/master/readmeai/services/git_operations.py) | This code snippet provides Git operations for cloning and validating repositories. It includes functions to clone a repository to a temporary directory, find the path to the Git executable, validate file permissions, and validate the path to the Git executable. These operations are crucial for managing and working with Git repositories within the parent repository's architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [git_metadata.py](https://github.com/eli64s/readme-ai/blob/master/readmeai/services/git_metadata.py)     | This code snippet in `git_metadata.py` fetches metadata for a Git repository, specifically from GitHub. It uses the `fetch_git_api` function to retrieve repository metadata from the Git API and the `process_repo_metadata` function to process the raw data into a `GitHubRepoMetadata` object. The `GitHubRepoMetadata` class stores various details about the repository, such as its name, owner, description, statistics, URLs, programming languages, and license information. Overall, this code provides a way to retrieve and process important information about a GitHub repository. |
