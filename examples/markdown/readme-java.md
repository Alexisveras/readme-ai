## 📦 Features

|    | Feature           | Description                                                                                                       |
|----|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ⚙️ | **Architecture**    | The project follows a simple Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with separate components for data, UI, and business logic. It also uses the Repository pattern for data management.             |
| 📄 | **Documentation**  | The project lacks comprehensive documentation. Some code comments are present, but overall, the documentation could be improved.|
| 🔗 | **Dependencies**   | The project relies on several external libraries, including materialdatetimepicker, textdrawable, and yaml. It also uses Google Play Services for notifications and settings.|
| 🧩 | **Modularity**     | The system is organized into smaller components, such as activities, fragments, and services, which can be easily interchanged and reused. |
| 🧪 | **Testing**        | The project includes unit tests for some classes, but overall, the testing strategy could be improved. It could benefit from more comprehensive test coverage and the use of automated testing tools.       |
| ⚡️ | **Performance**     | Performance considerations are not explicitly addressed in the codebase. More focus on optimizing resource usage and improving efficiency could enhance the system's performance.|
| 🔐 | **Security**       | The project does not have specific measures to address security concerns, such as encryption or secure data storage. Additional security measures could be implemented for sensitive user information.|
| 🔀 | **Version Control**| The project utilizes Git for version control, as seen from the presence of a `.git` directory. However, the repository does not provide further information on specific version control strategies or tools.|
| 🔌 | **Integrations**   | The project integrates with Google Play Services for notifications and settings. It also includes integration with external libraries for UI components and data parsing.|
| 📶 | **Scalability**    | The system's ability to handle growth is not explicitly addressed in the codebase. However, the use of a modular structure and separation of concerns provides a foundation for future scalability improvements.           |
